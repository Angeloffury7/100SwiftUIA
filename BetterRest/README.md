# Project 4 - BetterRest

## 📝 What I learned

Create ML, Core ML, DatePicker, Stepper, navigationBarItems(), Date, DateComponents, and DateFormatter

## 🏆 Challenges

> * Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!
> * Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
> * Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.

Second challenge was completed and is contained as a comment inside the project. A stepper implementation seemed like a better design in this case.
