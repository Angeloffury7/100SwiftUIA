# Project 1 -  WeSplit

## 📝 What I learned

Form, Section, NavigationView, @State, TextField, Picker, ForEach

## 🏆 Challenges

> * Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
> * Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
> * Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
