## 🏆 Challenges

> Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.
>
> Breaking it down:
>
> * The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 1 to 12.
> * The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, 20, or “All”.
> * You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for. For the “all” case you should generate all possible combinations.
>
> At the very least, you should:
>
> * Start with a Single View App template, then add some state to determine whether the game is active or whether you’re asking for settings.
> * Because the app has two very different states – “we’re asking the user for settings” and “the game is running” – you should use a Group as your top-level view, so that some View always gets the same view type being sent back.
> * Try and break up your layouts into new SwiftUI views, rather than putting everything in ContentView.
> *  Show the player how many questions they got correct at the end of the game, then offer to let them play again.
