# Challenge 1 - TempConvert

## 📝 Notes

Built a temperature conversion app that works around the logic of taking any input temperature input, converting it to a normalized value in Celsius and then converting it to the requested output.

## 🏆 Challenges

> Build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.
> Which units you choose are down to you.
